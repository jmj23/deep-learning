    "In the last year or so, a specialized type of deep learning model known as GANs have taken over image-to-image translation problems. GAN stands for Generative Adversarial Network. There are lots of resources online, but we'll provide a quick breakdown of them here in the context of medical imaging.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Generative: The model contains a \"generator\" that is responsible for turning the input image into the target image. The network we used for this example would serve as the generator.\n",
    "  - Adversarial: There is a second part of the model known as a \"discriminator\". The job of this discriminator is to determine whether an image that it is given is real or \"fake\": produced by the generator. It takes the form of a classification network that classifies the test image as real or fake. The score of the discriminator is used as the loss of the generator. Thus, these networks battle against each other in an adversarial way.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Initially, the generator will not produce very good images- T2 images for this example. The discriminator will easily tell the difference between real T2 and generator-produced T2 images, and the generator's loss will be high. However, the generator will learn from this loss and start producing better looking T2 images. Eventually, the generator will produce T2 images that are indistinguishable from real T2 images.\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been 100s of versions of different GANs developed. If you can use image-to-image translation in your work, they are definitely an area to explore."

    "## Answers to Questions\n",
    "#### 1- What is the purpose of the training, validation, and testing datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Training: These data are fed into the model, the loss is calculated on the results, and the weights in the network are updated based on that loss.\n",
    "* Validation: This dataset is checked at the end of every epoch, and is used to determine whether the model is overfitting the training data or is learning more general features that can apply to broader data.\n",
    "* Testing: Since the model sees the validation data during the course of training, a testing datset is occasionally kept separate and checked at the end of training for a truly independent measure of the model's performance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### 2- What are the consequences of different loss functions for this task?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main choices for this regression task: mean squared error or mean absolute error. There are mathematical differences in what each error encourages the model to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean square error encourages the output to be averaged. When there are multiple possible targets for given inputs to the model, it will learn to produce the average of these outputs. This results in smooth and sometimes blurry results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean absolute error encourages the output to be a median. This is usually better for image tasks. It can still produce blurry outputs in areas of uncertainty, but generally does a better job of preserving edges and subtler features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3- What do you notice about the input and target images?\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on which slice you chose to display, you can likely notice that there are imperfections in the registration of the input and target images- they aren't perfectly lined up. This is a common problem in medical imaging. For image-to-image translation tasks, it means that no matter how good your model is, there won't be a perfect solution. In fact, you might notice that the model's output aligns more closely with the input. This makes sense- the model has no idea that there are registration problems- it's just trying to convert one image to look like another.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are systematic registration problems (e.g. output is shifted, rotated from input) then the model will learn this bias and implement that in its solutions. If the problems are random, it likely won't be able to replicate them,  and be a little blurry instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in the state-of-the-art solutions to registration problems, search for \"CycleGANs\".\n"
