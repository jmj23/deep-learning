## ItATMIS 2.0

Iterative Annotation and Training for Medical Image Segmentation


## Motivation

The GUI contained in this directory will be designed to aid the tedious process of annotating medical images, while simultaneously preparing a deep learning model that can then be used on future image segmentation tasks.

## Usage

Install python package dependencies with
pip install -r itatmis_requirements.txt

A user manual is in the works and will be added here when ready.
Plans are also made for a windows-compatible binary, which will be shared when ready.
