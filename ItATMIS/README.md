Iterative Annotation and Training for Medical Image Segmentation


## Motivation

The GUI contained in this directory will be designed to aid the tedious process of annotating medical images, while simultaneously preparing a deep learning model that can then be used on future image segmentation tasks.

## Usage

This will be updated when the GUI is ready for use
