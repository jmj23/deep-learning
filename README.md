## Synopsis

This repository holds all of the code I use for various deep learning projects. 


## Motivation

I utilize github for keeping my code up-to-date on multiple machines. However, I also wish it to be of use to anyone who can make use of it. See License below.

## Usage

The sub-directory 'friendly' is the most accessible to outsiders, being well-commented, readable, and designed with generality and modularity in mind.
