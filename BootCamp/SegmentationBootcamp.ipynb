    "An important thing to look for is that the validation loss isn't increasing while the training loss decreases. The divergence of the losses like this means that the model is overfitting- it is getting really good at the training data that it sees, but it is getting worse at the data that it doesn't see. This means the model won't be very helpful when we want to apply it to new data.\n",
    "Due to the random initialization of the network, the exact loss plots will be different every single time you train it. However, for this example, some general statements can be made that probably apply to your results.\n",
    "* The validation and training losses generally go down. This is good- the model is learning.\n",
    "* The validation loss is generally higher than the training loss. This is expected- the model will learn the training data best because that is what it gets direct feedback on. The hope is that it will transfer what it learns to the validation data too.\n",
    "* The validation loss spikes up at some point. This is also pretty normal. The validation data isn't part of the feedback loop so it's not guaranteed that the model will consistently get better results on it. As long as the spikes are isolated and the validation loss follows a general downward trend, it's not anything to worry about."
